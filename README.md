# SpdCam
A simple dashboard/action camera application for android.

Adds current time and speed to camera preview and uses MediaProjection and MediaRecorder
to store the display content to a video file. 

Requirements:
Android 5.?.? device with camera and GPS.

Issues:
My test phones crash when the surface for virtualDisplay is set other than null.

TODO:
-Add GPS functions (speed & status)
-Add some settings (units, time format, video size/quality, etc.)
-Improve UI
